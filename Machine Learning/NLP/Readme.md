It involves developing algorithms to understand, interpret, and generate human language text or speech. NLP has applications in machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and more, using techniques like tokenization and machine learning to process and analyze textual data. The goal is to enable computers to understand and derive meaning from human language.
